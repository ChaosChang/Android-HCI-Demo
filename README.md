# Android-HCI-Demo
Working on Android Studio,just like a simplified map navigator

This APP includes 3 main parts: voice command, accelerate sensor control, gesture recognition.(I m sorry for naming this project wrong)
Voice command uses a 3rd party SDK(iflytek) to recognize Chinese and change it to strings(sorry for i didn't set English version). You can control the voice volume, jump to the designated place of the map and move the map.
gesture recognition is just click, double click, zoom in&out and drug.
accelerate control is according to the acceleration to set what activity is executed.
